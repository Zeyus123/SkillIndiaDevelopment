Write a program to check whether a string is a palindrome or not.

Input -> "madam" -> Is this string a palindrome -> YES
Input -> "gadag" -> Is this string a palindrome -> YES
Input -> "raghav" -> Is this string a palindrome -> NO
Input -> "aba" -> Is this string a palindrome -> YES
Input -> "abcd" -> Is this string a palindrome -> NO
Input -> "abda" -> Is this string a palindrome -> NO


str -> madam
	     <------- i
temp -> madam


is str.equals(temp)  ==> PALINDROME
is str.equals(temp)  ==> NOT PALINDROME


Write a program to find 1st non repeating charcter in a given string

	-> raghavendra
		-> r -> NO
		-> a -> NO
		-> g -> First Non  repeating character 
		-> h -> Non repeating character		
	
	-> skillindiaskan
	-> s ->NO
	-> k ->NO
    -> i -> NO
	-> l ->NO
	-> n -> NO
	-> d -> YES -> First Non repeating character in the string
	
	
Write a program to check given two stringsm, check whether they are anagrams or not?

	-> SAME SET OF Characters are used
			SILENT -> LISTEN  -> YES
			CARE -> RACE  -> YES
			PART -> TRAP  -> YES
			HEART -> EARTH  -> YES		
			RAGHAV -> ENDRA  -> NO		
			
			boolean areAnagrams(String input1, String input2){
			}
